# Twilio and NodeJS
This simple application sends an SMS to a recipient using Node and Twilio API

## Getting Started
1. Sign up for a free trial account at [Twilio](http://www.twilio.com/signup)
2. Get an Account SID
3. Get an Authentication Token
4. `npm install twilio` in the console

## Keeping your SID and Token secure
It is strongly advised to keep these keys hidden from your commit history since they can be compromised if they are visible. Instead of coding them into your application, save them as environmental variables and add the folder that contains the keys to your `.gitignore` file
